# Returning to the Last Node

A node can specify that its *next* node is the last node that was shown before the
current node. This is as easy as writing this on a new line at the end of your node:

```toothrot
(<)
```

You can also return to the last node with a certain [tag](tags.md). For example, if you want to
return to the last visited node that is tagged "room", you can write:

```toothrot
(<) room
```

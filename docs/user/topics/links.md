# Linking to Other Nodes

You can link to other nodes in a node's text by using this notation:

```toothrot
This is a link: [click me](#another_node)
```

The first part between `[` and `]` is the link text or label.
The second part, between `(#` and `)` is the name of the node that will be reached
when the user clicks on the link.

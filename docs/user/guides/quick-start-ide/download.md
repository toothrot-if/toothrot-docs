# Downloading Toothrot IDE

Toothrot IDE runs on the following operating systems:

* Windows 7+
* Mac OS X
* Linux

Before you can install the IDE, you need to download the right package for your system.
Head over to [the homepage](../../../../index.md) and click on the big "Download" button.
Your browser should now be downloading the correct version of the IDE for your system.

After clicking the download button, you will be redirected to installation instructions for
your system. If redirecting doesn't work (or you want to take a peek before downloading),
here are the installation instructions for each of the supported systems:

* [Install on Windows](install-windows.md)
* [Install on Mac OS X](install-mac.md)
* [Install on Ubuntu](install-ubuntu.md)
